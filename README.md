### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Igor Nunes, a Bachelor in Statistics and passionate about data science. I love exploring machine learning algorithms and neural deep neural networks like CNNs and transformers. My goal? To become a data science expert.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continuously enhancing my python skills for data science (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Statsmodels, Scikit Learn, Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, etc), machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks knowledge.
